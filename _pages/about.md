I am an Assistant Professor in the [Robotics Department](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I direct the Scalable Spatial Intelligence Lab.
I am passionate about developing **scalable and trustworthy autonomy** that operates robustly over long periods of time without human intervention.
My current research applies tools from nonlinear and distributed optimization, machine learning, and graph theory to develop principled **algorithms with theoretical guarantees** and **real-world systems** for spatial perception, navigation, and multi-agent systems.

Before joining Michigan Robotics, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the UC San Diego Contextual Robotics Institute (CRI) and the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).
I received my PhD degree from MIT AeroAstro in August 2023, with a focus on autonomous systems.
During my PhD, I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jonathan How.
Prior to PhD, I received my SM degree (2019) from MIT and BA degree (2017) from UC Berkeley.
