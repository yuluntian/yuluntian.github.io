I will be joining the Robotics Department at the University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2025!

**To prospective students: I am actively seeking highly motivated and talented PhD students starting in Fall 2025. [Click here for more details.](/students/)**
{: .blue}

I am passionate about developing **scalable and trustworthy autonomy** that operates robustly over long periods of time without human intervention.
My current research applies tools from nonlinear and distributed optimization, machine learning, and graph theory to develop principled **algorithms with theoretical guarantees** and **real-world systems** for spatial perception, navigation, and multi-agent systems.

I am a postdoc at UCSD working with [Prof. Nikolay Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io). 
Previously, I was a postdoc at MIT [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/) and [AeroAstro](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/).
I received my PhD degree from MIT AeroAstro in August 2023, with a focus on autonomous systems.
During my PhD, I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jonathan How](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/jonathan-p-how/). 
Prior to PhD, I received my SM degree (2019) from MIT and BA degree (2017) from UC Berkeley.
